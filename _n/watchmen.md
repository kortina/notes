I had seen (and really enjoyed) the film adaptation of _Watchmen_ a few years ago, and several
people told me to read the book ("because it's much better").

People often say this about the book, I picked up a copy, started it, didn't get far enough to see
the differences, put it down for years.

I picked up [the graphic
novel](https://www.amazon.com/Watchmen-Alan-Moore/dp/0930289234?tag={{site.amazon_tag}}) again (looking for something to follow _Gravity's Rainbow_) and really loved it. If you haven't seen / read it, it's AWESOME (and a great pandemic read).
