I first came across
Simon Stålenhag
years ago... I can't remember where.

I didn't read it, but recently came across again when Pinot W. Ichwandardi posted on twitter about
drawing Tales from the Loop [with 1-bit pixel
art](https://twitter.com/pinot/status/1248645617162899458).

So, I picked up [Things from the
Flood](https://www.amazon.com/Things-Flood-Simon-St%C3%A5lenhag/dp/1624650465{{ site.amazon_tag }}).

The story is vague, like a children's story or distant memory, which just adds to the surreal vibe.
And the artwork is gorgeous.
