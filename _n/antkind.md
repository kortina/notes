I've been on kind of a surreal / absurd kick -- with things like [Gravity's Rainbow](/n/gravitys-rainbow) and [Infinite Jest](/n/infinite-jest) -- and [Antkind](https://www.amazon.com/Antkind-Novel-Charlie-Kaufman/dp/0399589686) by Charlie Kaufman continues in this vein.

I'm not sure I have ever read a novel written by someone who's already a film writer/director (I feel like this usually goes in the other direction), but for some reason I had a lot of confidence a Kaufman book would be as good as a Kaufman film.

Like his movies, _Antkind_ is a mix of slapstick / black humor I often laughed out loud at with a fearless stare into the face of death and human mortality.

You will either love or hate this. I loved the brutal honesty.

Here are some of my favorite bits...

> “Yes, please,” I say.
