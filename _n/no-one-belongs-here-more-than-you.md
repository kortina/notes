Over the past few months, I read [Miranda July](/n/miranda-july.md); watched [_Me, You, and Everyone We Know,_ _The Future,_ _The Amateurist_](https://www.criterionchannel.com/directed-by-miranda-july); listened to [The Metal Bowl](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/fiction/emma-cline-reads-miranda-july), [Roy Spivey](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/fiction-podcast-david-sedaris-reads-miranda-july)
