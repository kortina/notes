I was talking to a friend recently about his favorite books on writing, and his top recommendation was Brian McDonald's [Invsible Ink](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Ink-Practical-Building-Resonate-ebook/dp/B06W5KC2ZR/).

I used to be kind of skeptical on process / formula books like this, but having gotten lost in some rabbit holes of story development recently, I have found returning to structural advice like this to be quite grounding.

This is one of the better books of this kind I have read.
