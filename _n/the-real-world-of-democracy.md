I heard about this via Ursula Franklin's Massey lecture, *The Real World of Technology.*

Macpherson's lectures feel a little ra-ra capitalism at points, but I'm not sure I have heard / read anything else that does quite so cut and dry a comparison of alternative "versions" of democracy (Western liberal democracy vs USSR style command socialism) as this.

You can listen to the lectures [here](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/the-1964-cbc-massey-lectures-the-real-world-of-democracy-1.2946802) or get on [kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Democracy-Massey-Lectures-ebook/dp/B00KTJ4K76).
