title: Wallace // Girl With Curious Hair
---

Over the past few weeks going down the DFW rabbithole -- a couple of weeks ago I read (and loved)
[Both Flesh and Note](/notes/n/both-flesh-and-not/) and I have been gearing up to retry _Infinite
Jest_.

The last thing on my list before _Infinite Jest_ was [Girl with Curious Hair](https://www.amazon.com/Girl-with-Curious-Hair-Stories/dp/B004F5UWTK/{{ site.amazon_tag }}).

There are (unsurprisingly) several great stories in here, but the final story, _Westward the Course
of Empire Takes Its Way_, is some of my favorite DFW I have read to date and it makes the whole
collection worthwhile.

> For whom is the Funhouse a house? Maybe for liars, creative types, campaigners, tree surgeons having at the great Saxonic tree. For Tom Sternberg, the Funhouse is less a place of fear and confusion than (grimace) an idea, an ever-distant telos his arrival at which will represent the revelated transformation of a present we stomach by looking beyond. A present comprised by fear of confusion.
