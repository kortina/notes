[Brief Interviews with Hideous Men](https://www.amazon.com/Brief-Interviews-Hideous-Foster-Wallace/dp/0316925195?tag=kortina0e-20) is a short collection of short stories by David Foster Wallace. I think on the whole I preferred [Oblivion](https://www.amazon.com/Oblivion-Stories-David-Foster-Wallace/dp/0316010766?tag=kortina0e-20) which touched on a lot of absurd topics in consumerism and marketing that I think often about, but a few of the stories in *Brief Interviews with Hideous Men* are just incredible and left me feeling devastated. In particular, the penultimate story #20 ([also published in full as #6 in the Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/fiction/1225/brief-interviews-with-hideous-men-david-foster-wallace)) is amazing.
