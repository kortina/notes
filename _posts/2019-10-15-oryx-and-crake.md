[Oryx and Crake](https://www.amazon.com/Unknown-Oryx-and-Crake/dp/B00009OYYN/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?tag=kortina0e-20) is the first book I’ve read by Margaret Atwood, and it feels very much in the spirit of Ursula Le Guin. It’s dystopian, misanthropic, bio-tech cyberpunk and I it feels very consistent with a future we are very likely headed toward.

I highly recommend it.
